# Tile Matching Game

## Introduction:
A memory-based game where players match pairs of tiles by flipping them over. The game tracks steps taken, time spent, and increases difficulty with each level.

## Problem Domain:
- Create a memory game that challenges players to match tiles.
- Manage dynamic game boards, user interactions, and progress tracking (steps and time).
- Increase game difficulty progressively.

## Solution Domain:
- **Backend**: **Flask** serves the game page and static files.
- **Frontend**: **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** manage game logic, tile flipping, animations, and UI responsiveness.
- **Game Logic**: Includes tile shuffling, matching detection, step and timer tracking, and difficulty scaling.

## Requirements:
- **Software**: Python 3.x, Web browser.
- **Dependencies**: Flask (for backend), basic knowledge of web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).

## Methodology:
1. **Frontend**: Use **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** for UI, tile flipping, and game mechanics.
2. **Backend**: **Flask** serves static content and manages routes.
3. **Game Logic**: Handles tile matching, steps, and timer. Difficulty increases as the game progresses.
4. **Testing**: Ensure the game is responsive and functions well across devices.

## Conclusion:
The **Tile Matching Game** is an interactive memory game that provides a fun and challenging experience. It is built using **Flask** for the backend and **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** for the frontend. Future improvements may include scoring systems, multiplayer modes, and sound effects.
